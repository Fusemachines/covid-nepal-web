            <p>Here are some things that you need to know to keep elderly people safer, and what to do if they do become infected with COVID-19 :</p>
            <p>- As a caretaker you should take all the precautions you can to <span className="text-bold">avoid becoming infected</span> yourself and eventually infect the elderly.<br/>- <span className="text-bold">Practice social distance</span> but not social isolation. Seniors should be encouraged to use technology to stay connected with their friends, children or their close circles.<br/>- Give them <span className="text-bold">small tasks</span> like organizing old pictures or cooking favorite family recipes to make them feel more involved.<br/>- <span className="text-bold">Postpone unnecessary doctor visits.</span> If an older adult in your care is feeling well, consider helping them postpone elective procedures, annual checkups and other non-essential doctor visits.<br/>- <span className="text-bold">Avoid travel.</span> Older adults should put off non-essential travel, particularly cruises or trips with itineraries that would expose them to crowds. <br/>- <span className="text-bold">Pick an emergency contact.</span> If youâ€™re the main caregiver, designate someone nearby whom you could rely on to care for your elderly family member if you yourself become ill.<br/></p>
