              Here are some things that you need to know to keep elderly people safer, and what to do if they do become
              infected with COVID-19 :

            <p>
              - As a caretaker you should take all the precautions you can to{' '}
              <span className="text-bold">avoid becoming infected</span> yourself and eventually infect the elderly.
              <br />- <span className="text-bold">Practice social distance</span> but not social isolation. Seniors
              should be encouraged to use technology to stay connected with their friends, children or their close
              circles.
              <br />- Give them <span className="text-bold">small tasks</span> like organizing old pictures or cooking
              favorite family recipes to make them feel more involved.
              <br />- <span className="text-bold">Postpone unnecessary doctor visits.</span> If an older adult in your
              care is feeling well, consider helping them postpone elective procedures, annual checkups and other
              non-essential doctor visits.
              <br />- <span className="text-bold">Avoid travel.</span> Older adults should put off non-essential travel,
              particularly cruises or trips with itineraries that would expose them to crowds. <br />-{' '}
              <span className="text-bold">Pick an emergency contact.</span> If youâ€™re the main caregiver, designate
              someone nearby whom you could rely on to care for your elderly family member if you yourself become ill.
